    "## Introduction\n",
    "College Scorecard Data is a rich dataset that enables effective decision-making by students interested in pursuing college in the US. It has a range of important information such as the costs, scores, socio-economic breakdowns, graduation percentages, future earnings, debt measures etc. It was announced as a policy initiative by President Obama in 2013 during a State of the Union Address.[1] The release of the dataset was an important milestone in ensuring transparency and enabling smarter decision-making on the part of students and their parents/guardians. It can also potentially inform policy decisions as value-addition at the college level is a strong component of social mobility.[2]"

    "## Background\n",
    "While for-profit organizations such as the U.S. News & World Report and Forbes have been serving the needs of the intended audience of this dataset, the unbiased nature of the College Scorecard dataset makes it distinguished from the above. For-profit institutions usually have no obligation to full transparency, and the intelligence layer on top of the raw data can be used to push an agenda that might not be in line with the interests of the end consumers (i.e. students in this case). Having a one-size-fits-all approach like these also have a tendency to be easily gamed: colleges artificially inflate their rankings by engaging in a downward spiral of doom.[3]\n",
    "For instance, assuming that graduation rate is one of the most important criteria for a particular ranking system, inclusion/diversity efforts by an institution can be met with a decrease in the ranking as students coming from a lower socio-economic background have a higher chance of dropping out. The dataset also stretches out far into the future (earnings after ~10 years), and the sample size is respectable enough to draw meaningful conclusions (compared to for-profit services such as Payscale, which includes a lesser number of institutions with not enough information about included sample sizes, which limits the reliability of most types of analysis)."

    "## Human Centered Design Considerations\n",
    "Human-centered design considerations have informed my understanding of the project from the scope to execution. While a generic ranking of the colleges might be a good starting point, it usually lacks a lot of important details. This study aims to account for different starting points in terms of student opportunities/abilities and identify institutions that are ideal for serving a very specific subset of the student population. The aim is to uncover institutions that add a lot of value by ensuring higher-than-expected earnings and/or graduation rates. It can be observed that some institutions admit students who were already \"destined\" for success, and the schools ranked high in traditional ranking paradigms usually provide a badge of exclusivity, reinforcing the cycle across time. Patterns emerging out of these clusters might help the less-advantaged students in identifying institutions that help them meet their goals."

    "## Summary of Findings\n",
    "* Public universities such as the University of California and the University of Texas systems seem to be driving diversity efforts in a good direction, and further research in their efforts can inform public policy initiatives. \n",
    "* It is more difficult than average to get an admission into diversity-focused colleges.\n",
    "* The completion rate is lower in diversity-focused colleges, and special programs can be formulated to avoid student drop-outs due to financial (and other) constraints. \n",
    "* The repayment rate is significantly lower in diversity-focused colleges. Further research is required to understand the reasons for the same and frame effective solutions. \n",
    "* It might also make more sense financially to attend a diversity-focused college, all else being equal. "

    "## Limitations of the Study\n",
    "* The College scorecard dataset is only limited to the students who have received a federal financial aid, which potentially biases the results.\n",
    "* Analysis performed only on colleges which had complete data for the variables under consideration (644/7175 colleges considered for the analysis).\n",
    "* The earnings data is recorded for 10 years after entry into the program, which can skew figures for programs which have longer time periods of study (such as medicine).  \n",
    "* The cost of living and tuition will not be the \"same\" across all colleges due to differences in the cost of living across states. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The study was a small exercise in demonstrating the power of open data in framing questions that are personally relevant. The notebook is constructed keeping in mind the reproducibility aspect, and the reader is encouraged to frame their own research questions.  \n",
    "College is an essential part of achieving the American Dream, and institutions that are trying to equalize opportunities by focusing on diversity deserve appreciation and support. We can see that the colleges focused on diversity are different from the regular colleges on a number of different parameters. The findings can also hopefully inspire further research to dive deeper into some of the reasons for the variances. "
